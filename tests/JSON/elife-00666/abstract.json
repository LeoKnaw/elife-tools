"This is the abstract. This article will describe the eLife article and the process.\n                    An abstract can contain any formatting, such as italics,\n                        bold, superscript, subscript or small caps. MathML is\n                    also allowed: \n                    \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\nm\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n                . eLife does not structure abstracts into sub headings expect in a clinical trial article, but the abstract can have\n                    multiple paragarahs. The sub DOI is always .001 as it is the first asset in any\n                    article. I have added an unmatched > bracket as this has been an issue for PubMed deposits in the past. If this was a clinical trial the clinical trial details would be listed at the end of the abstract: Clinical trial Registration: EudraCT2004-000446-20."
