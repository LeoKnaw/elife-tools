expected = "<p>RET can be activated in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> by its co-receptors and ligands <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the physiological roles of <italic>trans</italic> signaling are unclear. Rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) express <italic>Ret</italic> and the co-receptor <italic>Gfrα2</italic> and depend on <italic>Ret</italic> for survival and central projection growth. Here, we show that <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfrα2</italic> null mice display comparable early central projection deficits, but <italic>Gfrα2</italic> null RA mechanoreceptors recover later. Loss of <italic>Gfrα1</italic>, the co-receptor implicated in activating RET <italic>in trans</italic>, causes no significant central projection or cell survival deficit, but <italic>Gfrα1;Gfrα2</italic> double nulls phenocopy <italic>Ret</italic> nulls. Finally, we demonstrate that GFRα1 produced by neighboring DRG neurons activates RET in RA mechanoreceptors. Taken together, our results suggest that <italic>trans</italic> and <italic>cis</italic> RET signaling could function in the same developmental process and that the availability of both forms of activation likely enhances but not diversifies outcomes of RET signaling.</p>"
