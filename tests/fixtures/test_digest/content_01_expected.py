                    have influenced the evolution of animals and humans. Although bacteria are most
                    familiar as pathogens, they also produce small molecules that animals and other
                    eukaryotes need, although the details of these beneficial effects are not well
                    understood. The choanoflagellates are water-dwelling organisms that use their whip-like
                    flagella to move around, feeding on bacteria. They can exist as one cell or a
                    colony of multiple cells and, perhaps surprisingly, are the closest known living
                    relatives of animals. This means that experiments on these organisms have the
                    potential to improve our understanding of animal development and the transition
                    from egg to embryo to adult. Alegado et al. have explored how the morphology of
                        Salpingoeca rosetta, a colony-forming choanoflagellate, is
                    influenced by its interactions with various species of bacteria. In particular,
                    they find that the development of multicellularity in S.
                        rosettais triggered by the presence of the bacterium
                        Algoriphagus machipongonensis as well as its close
                    relatives. They also identify the signaling molecule produced by the bacteria to
                    be C32H64NO7S; this lipid molecule is an
                    obscure relative of the sphingolipid molecules that have important roles in
                    signal transmission in animals, plants, and fungi. Moreover, Alegado et
                        al. show that S. rosetta can respond to this
                    molecule - which they call rosette-inducing factor (RIF-1) - over a wide range
                    of concentrations, including concentrations as low as 10-17M. The work of Alegado et al. suggests that interactions between
                        S. rosetta and Algoriphagus bacteria could
                    be a productive model system for studying the influences of bacteria on animal
                    cell biology and for investigating the mechanisms of signal delivery and
                    reception. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms revealed by this work leave open
                    the possibility that bacteria might have contributed to the evolution of
                    multicellularity in animals."""
