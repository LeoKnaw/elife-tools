                                            u'Imaging of donor/acceptor interface morphologies by cryo-EM before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. (<b>A\u2013F</b>) Cryo-EM images of mixtures of donor (synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin 1) and acceptor (syntaxin and SNAP-25) vesicles before (<b>A\u2013C</b>) and approximately 35 s after (<b>D\u2013F</b>) 500 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (panels B, C, E, and F are close-up views). Vesicles were imaged in the holes of the substrate carbon film, visible as the darker areas in the image, in conditions that clearly show the lipid bilayers (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The particular images shown in this figure were selected out of total of 16 (before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition) and 21 (after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition) EM micrographs, respectively, with emphasis on showing point contacts before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition and extended interfaces after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition in order to illustrate the variety of these particular states. Arrows indicate interfaces between vesicles that are approximately perpendicular to the direction of the projection (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for definitions of all contact and interface types). Large black arrow: point contact (representative close-up in B), small black/white arrow: hemifusion diaphragm (representative close-ups in C and E), and large white arrow: extended close contact (representative close-up in F). Scale bars in A and D are 100 nm, and 20 nm in B, C, E, and F. (<b>G</b>) Distribution of vesicle sizes before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. Vesicle diameters were calculated from all cryo-EM images in both conditions (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). (<b>H</b>) Bar graph of the percentage of various vesicle interfaces, that is, point contacts, hemifusion diaphragms, and extended close contacts (including a few instances of mixed, i.e., extended/hemifused, interfaces), normalized with respect to the total number of interfaces observed before and after addition of 500 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In addition to the changes in the distribution of vesicle interfaces upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, some amount of complete fusion between vesicles occurred as indicated by the shift of the diameter distribution in panel G towards larger values.
