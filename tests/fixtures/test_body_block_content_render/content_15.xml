        <p>Cohort A included three subjects who were seen within 12 hr of HSV-2 recurrence, and who collected genital swabs every 5 min for 4 hr. This experiment assessed whether there were alterations in viral load related to the PCR assay or collection technique. Only small changes occurred during 5-min intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplement-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The mean absolute value of viral DNA copy difference between successive swabs was 0.20, 0.28, and 0.34 log<sub>10</sub> genomic copies in the three participants, and generally increased with time between swabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The mean difference in HSV DNA copies between swabs correlated tightly with time between swabs in two participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), with virtually no difference in viral quantity between swabs separated by 5-min intervals in all three subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Two episodes had negative mean differences in viral quantity with increasing time between swabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), while one episode had a slightly positive mean difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that we captured two episodes during a decay phase and one episode near a peak of viral production. The standard deviation of the mean absolute value of viral DNA copy difference between successive swabs was 0.16, 0.22, and 0.26 in the three participants, respectively, suggesting that differences of &gt;0.5 log<sub>10</sub> HSV-2 DNA copies that may occur over hours usually reflect true changes in viral load rather than noise in the data attributable to clinical collection or PCR technique.</p>
