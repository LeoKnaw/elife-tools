In response to this comment, we validated the XML against the DTD (JATS 1) each time we made an update. We also regularly used the \n                PMC validator to check our decisions against display on the PMC site, see Author response image 1., \n                Author response video 1 and Author response table 1. Single figure: The header of an eLife article example on the HTML page. Author response table Caption and/or a title is required for all author response assets However, some decisions required some communication with PMC \n                to discuss whether any of our updates could be accomodated by them - during this review we aimed to reduce the complexity of the XML structure and remove all \n                formatting and bioler plate text required for a PDF display format. We also produced buisness rules {Insert table} in order to produce rules for the \n                production systems and the website to follow. These buisness rules also informed the basis for a set of Schematron rules for our references.{Insert table} If an author referes to a reference in the response letter it is cross linked to the reference in the reference list (Coyne et al.,\n                1989), however, if it is a new reference only cited in the decision letter or author response it is not added to the main reference link and is just listed as free\n                text, for example, Butcher et al, 2006. If the author provides the reference it can be added as free text to the end of the letter, however, this is not a requirement\n                .",
