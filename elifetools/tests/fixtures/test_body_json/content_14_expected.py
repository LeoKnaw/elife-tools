In another sense, the answer is difficult. What does it mean to repeat the methodology? And what qualifies as the "same" results? Now that the first five Replication Studies in the <a href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a> have been published (see <a href="#B1">Box 1</a>), it is timely to explore how we might answer these questions. The results of the first set of Replication Studies are mixed, and while it is too early to draw any conclusions, it is clear that assessing reproducibility in cancer biology is going to be as complex as it was in a similar project in psychology (<a href="#bib9">Open Science Collaboration, 2015</a>).')
